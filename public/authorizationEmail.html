<!-- This file has been modified from the Google Forms add-on sample -->
<p>The Google Forms add-on <i>Turnstile for Forms</i> is set to run automatically
    whenever a form is submitted. The add-on was recently updated and it needs you
    to re-authorize it to run on your behalf.</p>

<p>The add-on's automatic functions are temporarily disabled until you
    re-authorize the add-on. You can accomplish this by opening one of the forms
    using the add-on and running the add-on through the menu. Alternatively, you can
    click this link to approve authorization directly:</p>

<p><a href="<?= url ?>">Click here</a> to re-authorize the add-on.</p>

<p>This notification email will be sent to you at most once per day until the
    add-on is re-authorized.</p>
